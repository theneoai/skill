## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- bash (macOS/Linux/WSL)
- A supported AI platform (Claude, OpenClaw, or OpenCode)

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theneoai/skill-writer.git
   cd skill-writer
   ```

3. Install to your platform (no build step required):
   ```bash
   ./install.sh                   # auto-detect
   ./install.sh --platform claude # specific platform
   ./install.sh --dry-run         # preview only
   ```

**No build pipeline** — all platform files are direct Markdown, hand-maintained. Changes to a platform's skill file are made by editing `{platform}/skill-writer.md` directly.

## Adding New Features

### Updating the Skill Framework

Most features live in `skill-framework.md` (the master specification) and are mirrored to each platform skill file.

Workflow:
1. Edit `skill-framework.md` first (source of truth)
2. Copy changes to `claude/skill-writer.md`, `openclaw/skill-writer.md`, `opencode/skill-writer.md`
3. For platform-specific content (e.g., `metadata.openclaw`), edit only that platform's file
4. Update companion files in `refs/`, `eval/`, or `optimize/` as needed
5. Test with `./install.sh --dry-run`

### Adding a New Template

1. Create file in `templates/`:
   ```bash
   touch templates/my-template.md
   ```

2. Follow the pattern from `templates/base.md` — fill required placeholders:
   `{{SKILL_NAME}}`, `{{ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION}}`, `{{TARGET_USER}}`, etc.

3. Test with CREATE mode in your AI assistant

4. Update the template selection table in `skill-framework.md §6 CREATE Mode`

### Adding a New Mode

1. Add a new `## §N Mode-Name Mode` section to `skill-framework.md`
2. Add the mode trigger to the YAML frontmatter `modes:` list and `triggers.en/zh` arrays
3. Add the mode to the routing table in `claude/CLAUDE.md`, `openclaw/AGENTS.md`, `opencode/AGENTS.md`
4. Mirror the section to all three platform skill files
5. Update README.md mode documentation

## Adding Platform Support

### Creating a New Platform Directory

Each platform is a self-contained directory with three files:

```bash
mkdir newplatform/
```

1. **`newplatform/skill-writer.md`** — copy from `claude/skill-writer.md` as base, then:
   - Update PATH CONVENTION comment to reference `~/.newplatform/` paths
   - Add any platform-specific YAML metadata block
   - Add any platform-specific sections (if the platform has unique capabilities)

2. **`newplatform/AGENTS.md`** — routing rules file:
   ```markdown
   <!-- skill-writer:start -->
   ## Skill Registry — Active Skills
   **skill-writer** is installed and active.
   ...routing table for all 8 modes...
   <!-- skill-writer:end -->
   ```

3. **`newplatform/install.sh`** — install script (copy from `claude/install.sh` as base):
   - Set `PLATFORM_HOME="${HOME}/.newplatform"` (or platform-specific path)
   - Install skill, companion files, routing file
   - Handle idempotent routing file merge with `<!-- skill-writer:start/end -->` markers
   - Support `--dry-run` flag

4. Update top-level `install.sh`:
   - Add platform to `detect_platforms()` function
   - Add platform to `--all` target list

5. Update README.md platform table

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Preview install (no changes made)
./install.sh --platform claude --dry-run

# Install and verify
./install.sh --platform claude
ls ~/.claude/skills/
ls ~/.claude/refs/

# Verify routing rules merged
grep -n "skill-writer:start" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Test idempotency (run twice, should produce same result)
./install.sh --platform claude
./install.sh --platform claude
```

### Skill Quality Check

After editing any skill file, verify quality:

1. Install to Claude: `./install.sh --platform claude`
2. In Claude: type `lean eval` and paste the skill content
3. Score should be ≥ 350/500 (LEAN threshold)
4. For certification: type `evaluate this skill` — score ≥ 700/1000 (BRONZE)

### Platform-Specific Testing

```bash
# OpenClaw
./install.sh --platform openclaw --dry-run
# Then: restart OpenClaw → type "create a skill" to verify routing

# OpenCode
./install.sh --platform opencode --dry-run
# Then: restart OpenCode → type "create a skill" to verify routing
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

   - Add a changelog entry

2. **PR Description Should Include:**
   - What changed and why
   - Which platforms are affected
   - How to verify the change
   - LEAN/EVALUATE score if you modified a skill file

3. **Review Process:**
   - Maintainers will review within 48 hours
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep discussion constructive

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): subject

```

## Style Guide

### Markdown Skill Files

- YAML frontmatter: 2-space indentation
- Sections: `## §N Section-Name` pattern
- Required sections: Skill Summary, §2 Negative Boundaries, §3 Mode Router
- Line wrap: 80–120 chars for prose, no wrap for tables/code
- Placeholders: `{{UPPER_SNAKE_CASE}}`

### Install Scripts

- Use `set -euo pipefail`
- Support `--dry-run` flag on all write operations
- Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
- Backup existing files before overwriting (`.bak.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`)
