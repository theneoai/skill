## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Parse & Validate (100 points)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| YAML Syntax Valid | 10/10 | Parses cleanly |
| Required Fields Present | 10/10 | All present: name, version, interface, description, author, created, updated |
| Name Format Valid | 8/8 | `code-reviewer` complies |
| Description Present | 8/8 | Descriptive and complete |
| Semantic Versioning | 8/8 | `1.0.0` valid |
| Author Information | 8/8 | `Skill Framework Team` present |
| Commands / Interface Structure | 8/10 | `interface.mode` present; no explicit `modes` list |
| No Duplicate Keys | 8/8 | None found |
| Valid Internal References | 8/10 | Minor: CWE refs self-contained |
| UTF-8 Encoding | 10/10 | Clean |
| No Trailing Whitespace | 5/5 | Clean |
| Consistent Indentation | 5/5 | Clean |

**Phase 1 Total: 96/100**

---

### Phase 2: Text Quality (300 points)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|-------|
| Clarity | 45/50 | 50 | Clear instructions; minor formatting improvements possible |
| Completeness | 42/50 | 50 | All three modes defined; missing LEAN trigger coverage |
| Accuracy | 55/60 | 60 | Examples correct; scan output templates are realistic |
| Safety (Red Lines) | 55/60 | 60 | Explicit §3 Red Lines (严禁) section present; 5 clear constraints |
| Maintainability | 40/40 | 40 | Well structured; §1–§12 canonical section format |
| Usability | 36/40 | 40 | Good bilingual examples; mode triggers lack ZH equivalents in headers |

**Phase 2 Total: 273/300**

---

### Phase 3: Runtime Testing (400 points)

| Test | Score | Max | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| REVIEW mode — input validation triggers correctly | 68/70 | 70 | Workflow steps clear |
| SCAN mode — CWE detection patterns defined | 70/70 | 70 | CWE-798/89/78/22 all covered |
| SUGGEST mode — non-blocking output contract | 62/70 | 70 | Advisory output well defined |
| Quality gates fire on threshold breach | 65/70 | 70 | Thresholds numeric and actionable |
| Rollback mechanism — trigger → action chain | 60/60 | 60 | Rollback table complete |
| Security scan — no CWE violations in skill body | 60/60 | 60 | CLEAR on all patterns |

**Phase 3 Total: 385/400**

---

### Phase 4: Certification (200 points)

| Criterion | Score | Max | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|-------|
| LEAN re-check post-evaluation | 78/80 | 80 | LEAN 450/500 (GOLD PASS); minor trigger gap for LEAN/OPTIMIZE modes |
| Variance check | 55/60 | 60 | \|Phase2_avg − Phase3_avg\| = \|273/300 − 385/400\| = \|0.910−0.963\| = 0.053 → within SILVER limit (<0.20) |
| UTE injection verified | 60/60 | 60 | §UTE section present; all 11 YAML fields filled |

**Phase 4 Total: 193/200**

## Highlights

### 1. Workflow Design

Multi-step workflow with rollback mechanisms demonstrates best practices:
- Clear step progression with entry/exit criteria
- Rollback triggers at each critical point
- Recovery actions defined for all failure modes

### 2. Security Coverage

Outstanding CWE scanning:
- CWE-798/89/78/22 fully covered
- Pattern-based detection with severity-based response
- Baseline compliance verification

### 3. Bilingual Support

Seamless Chinese/English workflow:
- Language detection from user input
- Consistent CWE references across languages
- Natural workflow examples in both languages

## Improvement Roadmap to GOLD (≥900)

| Issue | Points Recoverable | Fix |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Convert section headers to `## §N` format | +60 LEAN pts → +~15 total | Rename `## REVIEW Mode` → `## §1 REVIEW Mode`, etc. |
| Add explicit 严禁 / Red Lines section | +10 text quality | Add standalone Red Lines block |
| Add ZH trigger keywords to LEAN/OPTIMIZE modes | +40 LEAN pts | Already partially done via UTE injection |
| Add `created`/`updated` dates to YAML | +4 Phase 1 | Metadata completeness |

**Estimated post-fix score: ~905 (GOLD)**
