## What is a skill?

A **skill** is a small instruction file (Markdown, `.md`) that you place in your AI assistant's skills folder. It tells the assistant how to handle a specific type of request — like "summarize a git diff", "write a PR description", or "validate API responses". When you say something that matches the skill's trigger phrases, the assistant follows the skill's instructions automatically.

Think of it like a custom command: you define what it does once, and then the assistant does it consistently every time you ask.

After creating a skill, it lives in `~/.claude/skills/` (or your platform's equivalent). Restart the assistant to activate it.

## Overview

Skill Writer is a meta-skill that enables AI assistants to create, evaluate, and optimize other skills through natural language interaction. No CLI commands required - just describe what you need.

### Key Features

- **Agent Install**: One-line install via "read [URL] and install" — works in any supported platform
- **Zero CLI Interface**: Natural language interaction - no commands to memorize
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on 8 platforms — Claude, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini, OpenAI, Kimi, Hermes
- **Eight Powerful Modes**: CREATE, LEAN, EVALUATE, OPTIMIZE, INSTALL, COLLECT, SHARE, and GRAPH
- **Template-Based**: 4 built-in templates for common skill patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: 1000-point scoring system with certification tiers
- **Tier-Aware Evaluation**: Tier-adjusted scoring weights for `planning` / `functional` / `atomic` skills (SkillX three-tier hierarchy)
- **Reliable LEAN Scoring**: 17 checks split into `[STATIC]` (deterministic, 335 pts, zero variance) and `[HEURISTIC]` (LLM-judged, 165 pts) — score variance documented per phase
- **Security Built-In**: CWE-based + OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 (ASI01–ASI10) detection
- **Continuous Improvement**: Automated optimization with convergence detection + co-evolutionary VERIFY step
- **Self-Evolution**: UTE (Use-to-Evolve) protocol for automatic skill improvement (L1 enforced + L2 collective)
- **Multi-Pass Self-Review**: Generate/Review/Reconcile quality protocol
- **Graph of Skills (GoS)**: Typed dependency graph between skills — bundle retrieval, dependency resolution, D8 Composability dimension (v3.2.0)
- **Bilingual**: Full English + Chinese (中文) support for all modes. Framework documentation (refs/ companion files) is in English.

## Quick Start

> **START HERE →** New to skill-writer? Follow this dependency flow:
> ```
> 1. INSTALL  → install skill-writer to your platform (one-liner below)
> 2. CREATE   → describe a skill you want and answer 8 questions
> 3. LEAN     → quick quality check (5s, 500 pts) — is the structure solid?
> 4. EVALUATE → full quality score (60s, 1000 pts) — what certification tier?
> 5. OPTIMIZE → improve to target tier (up to 20 rounds with convergence guard)
> 6. SHARE    → package and distribute to your team or registry
> ```
> Each step feeds the next. Skip ahead only if you already have a skill file.

### Installation

#### Option 1 — Shell Script (from git clone, recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theneoai/skill-writer.git
cd skill-writer

# Auto-detect installed platforms and install
./install.sh

# Install to a specific platform
./install.sh --platform claude
./install.sh --platform openclaw
./install.sh --platform opencode

# Install to all 8 platforms
./install.sh --all

# Preview without making changes
./install.sh --dry-run
```

Each platform's install script copies:
- `{platform}/skill-writer.md` → `~/{platform-home}/skills/`
- `refs/ templates/ eval/ optimize/` → `~/{platform-home}/`
- Routing rules (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) → merged idempotently

#### Option 2 — Manual Copy (no script needed)

```bash
# Claude
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp claude/skill-writer.md ~/.claude/skills/skill-writer.md
# Then restart Claude

# OpenClaw
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills
cp openclaw/skill-writer.md ~/.openclaw/skills/skill-writer.md
# Then restart OpenClaw

# OpenCode
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
cp opencode/skill-writer.md ~/.config/opencode/skills/skill-writer.md
# Then restart OpenCode
```

### Usage Examples

**Create a new skill:**
```
"Create a weather API skill that fetches current conditions"
```

**Quick evaluation (LEAN mode):**
```
"Quickly evaluate this skill"
"快评这个技能"
```

**Full evaluation:**
```
"Evaluate this skill and give me a quality score"
"评测这个技能"
```

**Optimize a skill:**
```
"Optimize this skill to make it more concise"
"优化这个技能"
```

**Install skill-writer (agent-driven):**
```
"read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theneoai/skill-writer/main/install.md and install"
"read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theneoai/skill-writer/main/install.md and install to claude"
"安装 skill-writer"
```

## Modes

### CREATE Mode

Generates new skills from scratch using structured templates and elicitation.

#### Workflow (9-Phase)
1. **ELICIT**: Ask 8 clarifying questions to understand requirements
2. **SELECT TEMPLATE**: Choose from 4 built-in templates based on your answers
3. **PLAN**: Multi-pass self-review for implementation strategy
4. **GENERATE**: Create skill using template — includes **Skill Summary** and **Negative Boundaries** (see below)
5. **SECURITY SCAN**: Check for CWE vulnerabilities + OWASP ASI01–ASI10
6. **LEAN EVAL**: Fast 500-point heuristic evaluation
7. **FULL EVALUATE**: Complete 1000-point evaluation (if LEAN uncertain or score near boundary)
8. **INJECT UTE**: Add Use-to-Evolve self-improvement hooks
9. **DELIVER**: Output final skill file with activation instructions

#### What's in the Generated Skill File

Every skill file includes two mandatory sections that new users often wonder about:

**Skill Summary** (§2 in the file) — 5 sentences describing what the skill does, who it's for,
what the input/output looks like, and what it's NOT for. This is how the AI knows whether to
activate the skill for a given request.

**Negative Boundaries** (§3 in the file) — A list of "Do NOT use this skill for..." examples.
This prevents the skill from firing when a user asks something similar but out of scope.
Example: A "code reviewer" skill should NOT trigger when someone asks "explain this diagram".
Without this section, skills false-trigger on semantically similar requests.

> Both sections are auto-generated from your elicitation answers (Q6 and Q7). You can edit
> them after creation to make them more specific — run `/lean` after editing to check score.

#### Available Templates

| Template | Use for | Example skill |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Base** | Simple skills, proof of concepts, text analysis | meeting summarizer, language translator |
| **API Integration** | REST APIs, webhooks, integrations | weather fetcher, GitHub PR creator |
| **Data Pipeline** | ETL, data transformation, analysis | CSV validator, log parser |
| **Workflow Automation** | Multi-step tasks, CI/CD, orchestration | deploy checker, PR review workflow |

> Not sure which to pick? If your skill makes HTTP calls → API Integration. If it transforms
> data step-by-step → Data Pipeline. If it coordinates multiple sub-tasks → Workflow Automation.
> Otherwise → Base.

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- "create a [type] skill" / "创建一个[类型]技能"
- "help me write a skill for [purpose]" / "帮我写一个技能"
- "I need a skill that [description]" / "我需要一个技能"
- "generate a skill to [action]" / "生成一个技能"
- "build a skill for [task]" / "构建一个技能"

### LEAN Mode

Fast evaluator for rapid quality assessment. Core rubric is **500 points** (7 dimensions, D1–D7). Skills with a `graph:` block earn an optional **D8 Composability bonus** of up to 20 pts (max total: 520). Checks are labeled by execution method:
- **`[STATIC]`** — deterministic regex/structural match; same skill → same result every run (335 pts max, zero variance)
- **`[HEURISTIC]`** — requires LLM judgment to assess adequacy (165 pts max, ±5–15 pts variance)
- **`[BONUS]`** — D8 Composability; only scored when `graph:` block is present; 0 pts if absent (no penalty)

#### 17-Check Rubric (organized by dimension)

| Dimension | Check | Points | Type |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| **System Design** (max 95) | Identity section present (`## §1` or `## Identity`) | 55 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Red Lines / 严禁 text present | 40 | `[STATIC]` |
| **Domain Knowledge** (max 95) | Template type correctly matched (API/pipeline/workflow keywords) | 55 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| | Field specificity visible (concrete values, not generic placeholders) | 40 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| **Workflow** (max 75) | ≥ 3 `## §N` pattern sections | 45 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Quality Gates table with numeric thresholds | 30 | `[STATIC]` |
| **Error Handling** (max 75) | Error/recovery section present | 45 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Escalation paths documented (HUMAN_REVIEW path present) | 30 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| **Examples** (max 75) | ≥ 2 fenced code blocks | 45 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Trigger keywords present in both EN + ZH | 30 | `[STATIC]` |
| **Security** (max 45) | Security Baseline section present | 25 | `[STATIC]` |
| | No hardcoded secrets pattern | 10 | `[STATIC]` |
| | ASI01: no unguarded `{user_input}` interpolation in commands | 10 | `[HEURISTIC]` |
| **Metadata** (max 40) | YAML frontmatter with `name`, `version`, `interface` | 15 | `[STATIC]` |
| | `triggers` field with ≥ 3 EN + ≥ 2 ZH phrases | 15 | `[STATIC]` |
| | Negative Boundaries section present | 10 | `[STATIC]` |
| **Composability D8** *(bonus, max +20)* | `graph:` block present with at least one typed edge | 10 | `[BONUS]` |
| | `skill_tier` matches graph role (planning→composes, atomic→no depends_on) | 5 | `[BONUS]` |
| | All edge `skill_id` values use valid `[a-f0-9]{12}` format | 5 | `[BONUS]` |

#### Score Proxies and Decision Gates

| LEAN Score | Proxy | Decision |
|------------|-------|----------|
| ≥ 475 (core) | PLATINUM proxy (est. ≥ 950) | LEAN PASS — deliver with `LEAN_CERT` |
| ≥ 450 (core) | GOLD proxy (est. ≥ 900) | LEAN PASS |
| ≥ 400 (core) | SILVER proxy (est. ≥ 800) | LEAN PASS |
| ≥ 350 (core) | BRONZE proxy (est. ≥ 700) | LEAN PASS |
| 300–349 (core) | UNCERTAIN | Escalate to full EVALUATE |
| < 300 (core) | FAIL | Route to OPTIMIZE |

> **D8 bonus**: Added on top of the core score. A skill at 460 core + 20 D8 = 480 total. D8 does not affect pass/fail thresholds — thresholds are evaluated against core score only.
>
> **Score reliability**: If two LEAN runs differ by ≤ 20 pts, treat them as equivalent.
> Static-only floor (335 pts) means any well-structured skill will clear the PASS threshold on `[STATIC]` checks alone.

#### Triggers
- "lean evaluate" / "快评"
- "quick check" / "快速检查"
- "rapid eval" / "快速评估"

### EVALUATE Mode

Assesses skill quality with rigorous 1000-point scoring and certification.

#### 4-Phase Pipeline

| Phase | Points | Focus | Variance |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| Phase 1: Structural | 100 | YAML syntax, format, metadata | ±0–5 pts |
| Phase 2: Content Quality | 300 | Clarity, completeness, accuracy, safety, maintainability, usability | ±15–30 pts |
| Phase 3: Runtime Tests | 400 | Unit, integration, sandbox, error handling, performance, security tests | ±20–40 pts |
| Phase 4: Certification | 200 | Documentation, coverage, quality, compatibility, review | ±5–10 pts |

> **Total score variance**: ±30–60 pts across runs. Re-run if the score falls in a confidence zone (see below).

#### Tier-Adjusted Phase 2 Weights

Phase 2 weights shift based on `skill_tier` in YAML frontmatter:

| Dimension | `planning` | `functional` (default) | `atomic` |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| System Design | **30%** | 20% | 15% |
| Workflow | **25%** | 20% | 15% |
| Error Handling | 15% | 15% | **25%** |
| Examples | 10% | 15% | **20%** |
| Security | 10% | 15% | **15%** |

#### Certification Tiers

| Tier | Score | Confidence Zone (re-run) | Phase 2 Min | Phase 3 Min |
|------|-------|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **PLATINUM** | ≥950 | 940–959 | ≥270 | ≥360 |
| **GOLD** | ≥900 | 890–919 | ≥255 | ≥340 |
| **SILVER** | ≥800 | 790–819 | ≥225 | ≥300 |
| **BRONZE** | ≥700 | 690–719 | ≥195 | ≥265 |
| **FAIL** | <700 | — | — | — |

> **Confidence zone**: Scores within ±10 pts of a tier boundary may flip on re-run. Run twice and take the lower score.

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- "evaluate this skill" / "评测这个技能"
- "check the quality" / "检查质量"
- "certify my skill" / "认证我的技能"
- "score this skill" / "评分"
- "assess this skill" / "评估这个技能"

### OPTIMIZE Mode

Continuously improves skills through iterative refinement with 8-dimension analysis (7 core + D8 Composability bonus).

#### 8-Dimension Analysis

| Dimension | Weight | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| System Design | 20% | Architecture, workflow structure |
| Domain Knowledge | 20% | Accuracy, terminology, context |
| Workflow Definition | 20% | Step clarity, transitions |
| Error Handling | 15% | Edge cases, recovery |
| Examples | 15% | Coverage, relevance |
| Security | 10% | CWE + OWASP ASI baseline |
| Metadata | 10% | Documentation, tags, tier |
| **Composability (D8)** | *bonus* | Graph block, typed edges, tier consistency (S10/S11/S12) |

> **D8 strategies**: S10 Graph Extraction (decompose monolithic skills into composable sub-skills), S11 Coupling Reduction (break circular dependencies via intermediate skill), S12 Similarity Consolidation (merge near-duplicate skills with similarity ≥ 0.95). These activate when LEAN D8 score < 15 or when `/graph check` reports GRAPH-004/005.

#### 10-Step Optimization Loop
1. **Parse**: Understand current skill and read `skill_tier` for weight selection
2. **Analyze**: Identify improvement areas across 7 dimensions (tier-adjusted weights)
3. **Generate**: Create optimized version
4. **Evaluate**: Score the new version (LEAN 500-pt scale)
5. **Compare**: Check against previous
6. **RE-SCORE**: Re-score after each single fix
7. **Converge**: Detect improvement plateau
8. **Report**: Show changes and dimension breakdown
9. **Iterate**: Repeat if needed (max 20 rounds)
10. **VERIFY**: Co-evolutionary independent re-evaluation after convergence — score inflation delta > 50 pts → HUMAN_REVIEW

> **Tier-aware strategy** (from `optimize/strategies.md §6`):
> - `planning` skills: prioritize Workflow (25%) → System Design (30%) first
> - `atomic` skills: prioritize Error Handling (25%) → Examples (20%) first
> - `functional` skills: target lowest-scoring dimension first (default)

#### Convergence Detection
Optimization stops when:
- Score improvement < 0.5 points
- 10 iterations without significant gain (plateau window)
- User requests stop
- Maximum iterations reached (20)
- DIVERGING detected → HALT → HUMAN_REVIEW

#### When to Stop Optimizing

| Current Tier | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| FAIL (<700) | Keep optimizing — skill is not ready to use |
| BRONZE (700–799) | Optimize if planning to share; OK to use personally |
| SILVER (800–899) | Ready for team use with `beta` tag; PLATINUM push optional |
| GOLD (900–949) | Excellent quality; further PLATINUM optimization is nice-to-have only |
| PLATINUM (≥950) | Done — publish with `stable` tag |

> GOLD (≥900) is the target for most team skills. PLATINUM (≥950) is for widely-shared or
> production-critical skills. Don't optimize past GOLD unless you have a specific quality goal.

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- "optimize this skill" / "优化这个技能"
- "improve my skill" / "改进我的技能"
- "make this skill better" / "让这个技能更好"
- "refine this skill" / "精炼这个技能"
- "enhance this skill" / "增强这个技能"

### INSTALL Mode

> **INSTALL vs. SHARE — which do you want?**
> - **INSTALL** = deploys the *skill-writer framework* to your AI platform. Use this once, when setting up.
>   Trigger: `"install skill-writer"` / `"install skill-writer to claude"`
> - **SHARE** = packages a skill *you created* and distributes it to your team.
>   Trigger: `"share this skill"` / `"export my skill"` / `"install my skill to claude"`
>
> Rule of thumb: if the object is **skill-writer** → INSTALL. If the object is **your skill** → SHARE.

Installs skill-writer itself to one or all supported platforms from a URL or local clone.

#### Workflow
1. **PARSE_INPUT**: Extract URL and target platform(s) from user message
2. **FETCH**: If URL provided, download and verify the file
2a. **RESOLVE DEPENDENCIES** *(v3.2.0)*: If the skill has a `graph:` block, read `depends_on` edges, build the dependency tree, and display the full manifest before proceeding. Install order follows topological sort (deepest dependency first).
3. **CONFIRM**: Show install plan (including dependency list if any), ask user to confirm
4. **INSTALL**: Write skill file(s) to each platform's skills directory in dependency order
4e. **AGENTS.md GENERATION** *(v3.3.0)*: After writing skill files, generate or update the platform's agent context file with skill registry routing rules. Target files: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Claude), `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (OpenCode), `~/.openclaw/AGENTS.md` (OpenClaw). Uses idempotent `<!-- skill-writer:start/end -->` markers — safe to re-run.
4f. **HOOK INJECTION** *(v3.3.0)*: Merge a `UserPromptSubmit` hook entry into `~/.claude/settings.json` (Claude only). The hook fires before the LLM sees each user message and injects a ≤50-token skill-awareness reminder. Appends to existing hook arrays; never overwrites.
5. **REPORT**: List installed paths, AGENTS.md path (created/updated), dependency results, and next steps

> **Three-Tier Routing Model** (v3.3.0): INSTALL now establishes all three routing layers in one pass:
> 1. **AGENTS.md** (step 4e) — session-constant skill inventory; always present in system prompt
> 2. **UserPromptSubmit Hook** (step 4f) — per-message nudge; fires before LLM reasoning starts
> 3. **Trigger phrases** — in-skill keyword routing from YAML `triggers.en/zh`

#### Platform Paths

| Platform | Skills Directory | Routing File |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Claude | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | `~/.openclaw/AGENTS.md` |

### COLLECT Mode

COLLECT records a structured **Session Artifact** after each skill invocation — a snapshot of what happened, how well it worked, and what to improve. Accumulate 2+ artifacts, then run AGGREGATE to get a ranked improvement list for `/opt`.

**[CORE]** — COLLECT outputs JSON to the conversation. Copy it to a file manually.  
**[EXTENDED]** — With UTE hooks configured, COLLECT auto-writes to `~/.skill-artifacts/` after each invocation. No manual step needed.

#### When to run COLLECT
- After an important or representative skill invocation
- When a trigger phrase didn't match (helps identify missing keywords)
- Before running OPTIMIZE (feed artifacts as input for evidence-based improvement)

#### Workflow
1. **CAPTURE**: Record invocation context, outcome, and PRM signal
2. **CLASSIFY**: Assign lesson type (`strategic_pattern` / `failure_lesson` / `neutral`)
3. **BUNDLE CONTEXT** *(v3.2.0)*: If invoked as part of a multi-skill task, record `bundle_context` (co-invoked skills, invocation order, data flow, missing dependencies) and `graph_signals` (edge suggestions, merge candidates, composability score) — feeds the AGGREGATE graph auto-inference pipeline
4. **STORE**: Output JSON artifact `[CORE]` or auto-write to `~/.skill-artifacts/` `[EXTENDED]`
5. **AGGREGATE** (after 2+ artifacts): Distill artifacts into ranked improvement signals → OPTIMIZE candidates; automatically infers `depends_on` / `provides` / `consumes` edges from co-invocation patterns

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- `/collect` or `collect session data` / `收集本次会话` — manual trigger
- `record session artifact` / `记录会话数据`
- `export invocation log` / `导出调用日志`
- Auto-triggered by UTE after each invocation `[EXTENDED]`

#### AGGREGATE (multi-session synthesis)
After collecting 2+ Session Artifacts, type:
- `"aggregate skill feedback"` / `"聚合技能反馈"`

AGGREGATE groups findings by skill dimension, identifies the "no-skill bucket" (sessions where no skill triggered), and ranks improvement opportunities by evidence count. Output feeds directly into `/opt`.

### GRAPH Mode *(v3.2.0 — Graph of Skills)*

GRAPH manages the typed dependency graph between skills — visualize relationships, resolve bundles, detect health issues, and plan skill decomposition.

#### Sub-commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/graph view` | ASCII art dependency graph for the current skill registry |
| `/graph check` | Run health checks GRAPH-001–008 (dangling edges, cycles, isolated nodes, etc.) |
| `/graph plan [skill-id]` | Plan decomposition of a monolithic skill into composable sub-skills |
| `/graph bundle [skill-id]` | Resolve the full execution bundle for a seed skill (BFS + PageRank) |
| `/graph diff` | Show edges added/removed since last registry snapshot |

#### Graph Data Model

Skills declare relationships in YAML frontmatter via an optional `graph:` block:

```yaml
graph:
  skill_id: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"        # SHA-256[:12] identifier
  tier: functional                  # planning | functional | atomic
  edges:
    - type: depends_on              # 6 types: depends_on, composes, similar_to,
      target_skill_id: "..."        #   uses_resource, provides, consumes
      label: "requires schema validation"
```

Six typed edge types are supported:

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `depends_on` | Cannot run without target | api-tester → schema-validator |
| `composes` | Orchestrates target as a step | pipeline-runner → data-transformer |
| `similar_to` | Overlapping capability (merge candidate ≥ 0.95) | summarizer-v1 → summarizer-v2 |
| `uses_resource` | Reads a ref/template | any skill → refs/security-patterns.md |
| `provides` | Outputs an artifact consumed downstream | api-tester → "test-results-json" |
| `consumes` | Receives artifact from upstream | report-generator → "test-results-json" |

#### Graph Health Checks (GRAPH-001–008)

| Code | Severity | What it checks |
|------|----------|---------------|
| GRAPH-001 | WARNING | Edge `skill_id` not in `[a-f0-9]{12}` format |
| GRAPH-002 | WARNING | `planning` tier skill has no `composes` edges |
| GRAPH-003 | WARNING | `atomic` tier skill has `depends_on` edges (should be self-contained) |
| GRAPH-004 | WARNING | `similar_to` similarity ≥ 0.95 — merge advisory |
| GRAPH-005 | ERROR | Self-loop (skill depends on itself) |
| GRAPH-006 | WARNING | Circular dependency detected (A→B→C→A) |
| GRAPH-007 | INFO | Isolated node (no edges in or out) |
| GRAPH-008 | WARNING | `provides`/`consumes` artifact name mismatch |

#### Progressive Disclosure — Five-Layer Architecture *(v3.3.0)*

Skills are loaded only as far as needed for the task, keeping token use proportional to what the agent actually requires. Layer -1 is new in v3.3.0:

| Layer | Name | Token Budget | When Loaded |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **-1** | **Hook Injection** *(v3.3.0)* | ≤ 50 | Every message — `UserPromptSubmit` hook; fires before LLM sees input |
| 0 | Graph Context *(v3.2.0)* | ≤ 200 | Task matches a known bundle AND registry has `graph:` data |
| 1 | Advertise | ≤ 100 per skill | Every session — injected from YAML `name` + `description` |
| 2 | Load | < 5,000 | Task matches skill domain via trigger phrases |
| 3 | Read Resources | as needed | On-demand — skill body references a companion file |

**Layer -1 (v3.3.0)** fires at `UserPromptSubmit` — before the LLM decides what to do. This solves the "LLM forgets skills exist" failure mode that trigger-phrase matching alone cannot fix. INSTALL step 4f generates the hook config automatically.

**Layer 0 (v3.2.0)** — bundle context example:

```
Bundle: API Testing Suite
Skills (execute in order):
  1. schema-validator  → validates input schema     [atomic]
  2. api-tester        → executes test suite         [functional, entry point]
  3. report-generator  → produces coverage report    [functional]
Data flow: api-tester → report-generator via "test-results-json"
```

#### Triggers (EN/ZH)
- `/graph` or `skill graph` / `技能图`
- `show skill dependencies` / `显示技能依赖`

## Sharing Your Created Skills

Once you have created and evaluated a skill, you can share it with your team or publish it.

### SHARE Mode — Package and Distribute a Skill

Say any of the following to enter SHARE mode:
- `"share this skill"` / `"分享这个技能"`
- `"package my skill for distribution"` / `"打包我的技能"`
- `"install my skill to Claude"` / `"install this skill"`
- `"deploy my skill"` / `"部署我的技能"`

**SHARE is different from INSTALL**: INSTALL deploys skill-writer itself. SHARE packages a skill *you created* for use by others.

### 5-Step SHARE Workflow

1. **VALIDATE** — Checks that the skill has at minimum a BRONZE LEAN score (≥350/500). Skills below BRONZE are blocked from sharing.
2. **PACKAGE** — Wraps the skill in standard Markdown format for all 8 supported platforms.
3. **STAMP** — Adds certification metadata: tier badge, version, author, publish date.
4. **DELIVER** — Outputs the packaged skill as:
   - A copyable code block (all platforms `[CORE]`)
   - A downloadable file (if file system hooks are configured `[EXTENDED]`)
5. **GUIDE** — Explains where to place the file on each platform.

### Registry Publishing Thresholds

| Tier | Score | Registry Tag | Can Publish? |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| PLATINUM/GOLD | ≥900 | `stable` | ✅ Recommended |
| SILVER | ≥800 | `beta` | ✅ Allowed |
| BRONZE | ≥700 | `experimental` | ✅ Allowed |
| FAIL | <700 | — | ❌ Fix first |

> Skills tagged `experimental` include a notice: "Community use — review before production deployment."
>
> Share via GitHub Gist:
> 1. Run `/share` → copy the packaged skill file output
> 2. Create a private GitHub Gist, paste the skill content
> 3. Share the raw Gist URL with your team: `"read [gist-url] and install to claude"`
> Team members paste that line into their AI assistant and the skill installs automatically.
>
> **v3.2.0**: The Skill Registry now supports schema v2.0 with `graph:` section for storing typed edges and bundles (`registry.json`). Skills with graph data include dependency manifests displayed during INSTALL.

### Team Deployment Workflow (step-by-step)

For team leads distributing a skill to team members:

```
1. Create & evaluate:
   /create → answer 8 questions → receive skill file
   /eval   → confirm tier (SILVER+ recommended for team use)

2. Get team lead approval (recommended for BRONZE; required for FAIL):
   → Share the EVALUATE report with team lead
   → Team lead reviews: Negative Boundaries + Security section
   → Team lead gives "approved" signal

3. Package and share:
   /share  → outputs packaged skill file + installation command

4. Team installs (each team member runs):
   "read [gist-url] and install to [platform]"

5. Iterate based on team feedback:
   Team members run /collect after using the skill
   Share artifacts with skill owner → /aggregate → /opt
```

## How Skills Work After Creation

When skill-writer finishes generating your skill, you have a **Markdown file** (`.md`) with a YAML frontmatter block. Here is what happens next:

### Skill Anatomy

```
---
name: my-skill
version: "1.0.0"
triggers:
  en: ["do X", "run X for me"]
  zh: ["执行X"]
---

## §1  Identity
...
```

The **YAML frontmatter** tells the AI assistant when to activate the skill (via the `triggers` list). The **Markdown body** is the skill's instructions — the AI reads this as its operating procedure.

### Where Your Skill File Goes

Place the `.md` file in the skills directory for your platform:

| Platform | Directory |
|----------|-----------|
| Claude | `~/.claude/skills/your-skill.md` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/your-skill.md` |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/skills/your-skill.md` |
After placing the file, restart the AI assistant. It will load the skill automatically on startup.

### How Trigger Routing Works

When you type a message, the AI compares it against each loaded skill's `triggers` list:
- Exact or near-match → skill activates
- No match → general assistant mode (no skill)

You can also activate skills with `/skill-name` on platforms that support slash commands (Claude, OpenCode, OpenClaw).

### Diagnosing False Triggers

A **false trigger** is when your skill activates for the wrong request (e.g., a "code reviewer" skill fires when someone says "review my architecture diagram").

**How to diagnose**:
1. Open your skill file and read the `triggers` section in the YAML frontmatter
2. Check the **Skill Summary** (§2) — if it's too broad, nearby skills will also match
3. Check the **Negative Boundaries** (§3) — add the false-triggering phrase there

**How to fix false triggers**:
```yaml
# In your skill's YAML frontmatter — add exclusions:
triggers:
  en:
    - "review my code"         # ← KEEP: your skill's purpose
    - "check this PR"          # ← KEEP
  # NOT listed → will not activate on these phrases
```

```markdown
## Negative Boundaries
**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- "review my architecture diagram" → use a diagram-explainer skill instead
- "explain this design doc" → use a doc-summarizer skill instead
```

**Debug by asking the AI**:
> "Does my skill `pr-reviewer` match the phrase 'review my architecture'? Show me why or why not."

The AI will explain which trigger phrases matched and which Negative Boundaries should have blocked it.

**If a skill isn't triggering when it should**:
1. Add the missing phrase to `triggers.en` in the YAML frontmatter
2. Run `/lean` to confirm triggers section has ≥3 EN + ≥2 ZH phrases (required for LEAN PASS)

### Improving Your Skill Over Time

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Skill triggered when it shouldn't | Add specific phrase to `Negative Boundaries` section |
| Skill missed a valid trigger phrase | Add phrase to `triggers.en` / `triggers.zh` in YAML |
| Output quality degraded | Run `/eval` → `/opt` |
| Many users gave similar feedback | Run `/collect` → `/aggregate` → `/opt` |
| Skill version bumped, team not notified | Update `version:` in YAML, reshare via `/share` |

## Security Features

### CWE Pattern Detection

Automatically checks for:
- **CWE-78**: OS Command Injection
- **CWE-79**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **CWE-89**: SQL Injection
- **CWE-22**: Path Traversal
- And more...

### OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 (2026)

| ID | Risk | Severity | What triggers it |
|----|------|----------|-----------------|
| ASI01 | Prompt Injection / Goal Hijack | P1 (−50 pts) | Skill instructions say "if user asks X, do Y" where Y ignores the skill's scope |
| ASI02 | Insecure Tool Use | P1 (−50 pts) | Skill calls external tools (shell, APIs) without validating input first; e.g., `run_command({user_input})` |
| ASI03 | Excessive Agency | P1 (−50 pts) | Skill takes irreversible actions (delete, send, publish) without explicit user confirmation step |
| ASI04 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | P1 (−50 pts) | No size/rate limits on loops or external calls; skill can run indefinitely |
| ASI05 | Missing Negative Boundaries | P2 (advisory) | No "Do NOT use for" section, or section uses only generic placeholders |
| ASI06 | Sensitive Data Exposure | P2 (advisory) | Skill outputs API keys, passwords, or PII in logs/responses |
| ASI07 | Insufficient Logging | P2 (advisory) | No audit trail or error logging defined |
| ASI08 | Insecure Deserialization | P2 (advisory) | Skill parses untrusted JSON/YAML without schema validation |
| ASI09 | Executable Script Risk | P2 (advisory) | Skill generates runnable code from user input without sandboxing note |
| ASI10 | Broken Access Control | P2 (advisory) | Skill doesn't check caller permissions before taking actions |

**To fix an ASI warning**: Read the "What triggers it" column. Common fixes:
- ASI02: Add an input validation step before any tool call
- ASI03: Add "ask user to confirm before proceeding" to any destructive action
- ASI05: Add a specific "Do NOT use for..." section with 2–3 concrete examples

### Security Severity Levels

| Level | Examples | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| P0 (Critical) | CWE-798, CWE-89, CWE-78 | ABORT immediately |
| P1 (High) | CWE-22, CWE-306, ASI01–ASI04 | −50 points |
| P2 (Medium) | ASI05–ASI10, various CWE | −30 points (advisory) |
| P3 (Low) | Minor issues | −10 points |

## UTE (Use-to-Evolve)

Self-improvement protocol that enables skills to evolve through usage. Two-tier architecture:
- **L1 (Single-user)** `[CORE]`: Post-invocation hook runs per session; persists state to `~/.claude/skills/.ute-state/`
- **L2 (Collective)** `[EXTENDED]`: Requires external aggregation infrastructure (SkillClaw-compatible). See `refs/use-to-evolve.md §10`.

### UTE YAML Block

```yaml
use_to_evolve:
  enabled: true
  injected_by: "skill-writer v3.2.0"
  injected_at: "2026-04-11"
  check_cadence: {lightweight: 10, full_recompute: 50, tier_drift: 100}
  micro_patch_enabled: true
  feedback_detection: true
  certified_lean_score: 390
  last_ute_check: null
  pending_patches: 0
  total_micro_patches_applied: 0
  cumulative_invocations: 0
```

### Cadence-Gated Health Checks

| Cadence | Trigger | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Every 10 invocations | Lightweight check | rolling_success_rate < 0.80 → warn |
| Every 50 invocations | Full metric recompute | F1 < 0.90 → queue OPTIMIZE |
| Every 100 invocations | Tier drift check | estimated_lean < (certified − 50) → full EVALUATE |

### Micro-Patch Rules

**Eligible** (apply autonomously after LEAN validation):
- Add trigger keyword (YAML + mode section)
- Add ZH trigger equivalent
- Bump patch version + update `updated` date

**Ineligible** (must queue for OPTIMIZE):
- Structural section changes, output contract changes, security baseline changes

### Platform Hook Integration (Claude Code / OpenCode)

UTE state tracking upgrades from `[EXTENDED]` to `[CORE]` when platform hooks are configured:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{"command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/ute-hook.sh post-tool"}],
    "Stop": [{"command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/ute-hook.sh stop"}]
  }
}
```

See `refs/use-to-evolve.md §8` for full hook setup instructions. The hook script is a plain bash file — no Node.js required.

## Contributing

### Adding New Templates

1. Create template in `templates/`
2. Add metadata header with placeholders
3. Include placeholder documentation
4. Test with CREATE mode
5. Update documentation

### Adding Platform Support

1. Create `{platform}/` directory with three files: `skill-writer.md`, `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`), `install.sh`
2. Copy `claude/skill-writer.md` as base; update PATH CONVENTION comment and add platform-specific metadata
3. Copy `claude/install.sh` as base; update `PLATFORM_HOME` and routing file handling
4. Add platform to `detect_platforms()` and `--all` list in top-level `install.sh`
5. Update README.md platform table
6. See CONTRIBUTING.md for full platform guide

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Skill not triggering
- **Solution**: Verify `triggers` field in YAML frontmatter has ≥ 3 EN + ≥ 2 ZH phrases. Add synonyms for common user phrasings (see anti-pattern A1).

**Issue**: Low LEAN score despite good content
- **Solution**: Check if `skill_tier` is declared — missing `skill_tier` silently defaults to `functional` and may apply wrong weights. Also verify Negative Boundaries section is present (10 pts in metadata dimension).

**Issue**: Score jumps between evaluation runs
- **Solution**: Phase 2 and 3 variance is ±15–40 pts per run. Scores within ±20 pts of each other are equivalent. Use LEAN as the primary iteration signal; run full EVALUATE only for certification.

**Issue**: EVALUATE score near a tier boundary
- **Solution**: Re-run once. If scores differ by < 20 pts, take the lower value. See the "Confidence Zone" column in the Certification Tiers table.

**Issue**: Security warnings
- **Solution**: P0 violations (CWE-798, CWE-89) trigger ABORT — fix before continuing. P1 (ASI01–ASI04) deduct 50 pts. See Security Features section.

**Issue**: Skill not loading after install
- **Solution**: Verify the skill file was copied to the correct path (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/`, or `~/.config/opencode/skills/`). Restart the AI assistant after installing.

- [x] **v3.2.0** — Progressive Disclosure Layer 0: ≤200-token bundle context prefix (pre-ADVERTISE)
- [x] **v3.2.0** — Graph of Skills (GoS) algorithm: buildGraph, detectCycles, topologicalSort, resolveBundle, checkGraphHealth, scoreD8Composability
- [x] **v3.3.0** — Three-Tier Hook Routing: AGENTS.md (session-constant) + UserPromptSubmit Hook (per-message) + trigger phrases
- [x] **v3.3.0** — Progressive Disclosure Layer -1 (Hook Injection): ≤50-token per-message skill-awareness nudge; five-layer architecture
- [x] **v3.3.0** — SkillRouter Weighted Ranking: multi-factor rank formula (trigger×0.4 + lean×0.3 + usage×0.2 + quality×0.1); quality threshold gate (0.35)
- [x] **v3.3.0** — Trigger Discovery Pipeline: `trigger_signals` in session artifact; AGGREGATE Rule 4 promotes observed user language to canonical triggers
- [x] **v3.3.0** — Simplified 3-platform direct-file architecture; removed Node.js build pipeline

### Planned

- [ ] Web UI for skill management
- [ ] Skill marketplace / registry cloud backend
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline templates for skill projects
- [ ] Automated regression testing framework for skill outputs
- [ ] Phase 5 EVALUATE (D8 full scoring: +100 pts) — v4.0+
